		<h1>Basic Information</h1>

			<p>Betta fish (Betta splendens), formerly known as the Siamese Fighting fish, are a beautiful fish that are often kept by many for their flowing fins and their unique personalities. Because of their home in the wild, they have adapted in order to survive in their everchanging environments by developing labrynth organs. With their labrynth organs they are able to breathe oxygen from the air and take in oxygen through their gills. Obviously, betta fish aren’t ampibians, they still need bodies of water in order to survive and cannot breathe unless they are at least moist. But, their labrynth organs do allow them to live in shallow water by breathing in oxygen from the air around them and allow them to live outside of water for SHORT periods of time.</p>

			<p>Males and females look somewhat different from each other. Males tend to have much longer, flowing fins and are the ones most commonly seen in many pet stores. They also have longer and flatter bodies, a larger “beard”, and tend to blow bubble nests when they are happy. Females, on the other hand, are smaller in size and have shorter fins. In their native habitat they tend to be predominantly dull green or brown. In pet stores they come in a variety of colors.</p>

		<h1>Behavior</h1>

			<p>Betta fish are naturally intelligent and curious fish. If your betta is healthy, they will be constantly swimming around and exploring their surroundings. They are also voracious eaters and will soon recognize you as their source of food. Don’t let their appetite fool you, just because your betta comes up for food doesn’t mean they are hungry. In fact, overfeeding them can lead to complications such as bloating.</p>

			<p>Betta fish are infamous for their aggression, but they aren’t necessatily aggressive towards all fish. Bettas are semi-aggressive fish that tend to fight each other for territory. In their natural habitat they casn get away with this as the losing betta has the option to retreat after the fish duke it out for a couple of minutes. In captivity, however, bettas don’t have anywhere to escape to - which is the main reason why two male bettas cannot be placed in the same tank without a divider.</p>

			<p>Female bettas can be housed together in betta “sororities”, but doing so still carries risk for aggression while they establish a pecking order and can suddenly arise unwarranted. If this is to be attempted a large tank is required and a back up plan must be put in place.</p>

			<p>Bettas flare their gills when they feel threatened or when trying to show off. They flare their gills in order to make their faces appear bigger. You may witness your betta at home flaring at their reflection in the aquarium glass. Some flaring is healthy for your betta, but if the flaring becomes excessive then you might need to take measures to ensure that they can’t see their reflection, such as by putting decorative plants along the aquarium glass in order to break their line of sight.</p>

			<p>When male bettas are happy with their environbment they like to build bubble nests. A bubble nest is a cluster of bubbles on the surface of the water that your betta might make. In the wild they build bubble nests in order to prepare to mate with a potential female. They only do this if they are satisfied with their territory, so if your male betta builds one consider it a compliment!</p>

			<p>However, some bettas don’t build bubble nests, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they aren’t happy. As long as they are curiously exploring the tank and approaching the top of the tank whenever you approach then it is safe to assume that your betta is happy and excited to see you (or excited for food).</p>

			<p>Betta fish also sleep at night. Many bettas prefer sleeping close to the surface of the water, while some prefer sleeping on the ground. My betta likes sleeping among the roots of the floating plants in my aquarium, but he occasionally sleeps on the driftwood instead.</p>

		<h1>History</h1>

			<p>Betta fish have been around for centuries and have been highly prized as pets for a long time. The craze started in 1840, when the King of Siam took an interest in betta fish for their territorial nature and fighting instinct. In the meantime, natives purposefully collected and bred these fish for fighting matches, and the king soon took interest in the sport. Betta fish matches were commonplace and many placed bets of who would win, including the king himself. He kept his winning bettas close and became so engrossed in the sport that he sanctioned regular betta matches and placed special taxes.</p>

			<p>Betta splendens have been selectively bred for aggression because of this history, and their aggressive nature still lingers to this day. Fortunately, we no longer hold these “betta fights” and instead breed them for color and tail shapes. Due to this selective breeding betta fish that are commonly sold as pets look vastly different from their wild counterparts, and are often more aggressive than them too. In the wild they have shorter fins and come in shades of green and brown, but the selectively bred bettas come in many different colors and have a wide variety of tail shapes.</p>
